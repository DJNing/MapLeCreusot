# Main schedule

Drafted by Deng 23/10/2019

## Research

- [x] General research for libraries we will use.
  - Due data: end of Oct.
  - Result:
    - Decide to use `cartotype` for our development. `Libosmium` and other library recommended in Yohan's tutorial will be considered as backup plan.

## Coding / Development $\quad$ `From 23 Oct. to 23 Nov.`

      - [ ] How to do place searching for users
      - [ ] How to search path for users
      - [ ] choose travel mode
      - [ ] showing path for navigation

  - [ ] Key algorithm implementation $\quad$ **Deng**
    - [ ] Research on the basic principles for path planning
    - [ ] Research on libraries for path planing/ Or build our own library for this
    - [ ] Implement the algorithms
      - [ ] Basic path planning
