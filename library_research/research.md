## Mapnik

<font size = 3>

- [x] Cross platform
- [x] offline supported

### Features

- Platform supported
  - windows
  - linux
  - freeBSD
  - Mac OS X
  - Solaris
- Detailed installation documentation
- Support OSM XML dataset

### Problems

- No enough example and API documentation to get familiar with it, may cause a bit more time to go through the library
- require python for the project, makes it a multi-language project, more difficult to manage.

### Qt Location

- [x] Cross platform
- [x] offline support

### Features

- Tons of API
- Forum support
- maybe more stable

### Problems

- To complete the application, as the documentation stated: [Currently it is not possible to interact with maps via C++. Mapping applications must use the Maps and Navigation (QML) API.](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.11/location-maps-cpp.html) In this case, if we use this library, it would be a multi-language project.

## Cartotype

- [x] Cross platform
- [x] offline support

### Features

- You can find basically all the functions you need for this project.
- Officially support [OpenStreetMap offline](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_offline)
- A complete map app with open source code using this library. Basically shows you everything about how to do this project

### Problems
