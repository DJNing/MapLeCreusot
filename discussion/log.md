### Notes

- Using [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as reference
- Git tutorial and reference: [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) very detailed tutorial.
- Using [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as workflow reference. Branch `master`, `release` and `develop` will be in the platform while the others will only be in your local PC.
- Something about [git rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#workflow-walkthrough), very important
