- draft for task division

## Map data manipultion

### Import data

- reading data provided from some open source organization

### Design database (structure)

- Highly coupled with the implementation of the `key algorithms`. Be careful of the choice
- **Important** to do research on this

### Marking shops, buildings and other places

- Collecting data and add it to the map

## Key algorithm implementation

### Path planning

- Need Research on this

### Location Searching

- Highly coupled with the database (data structure) we build.
- Need research on this

## User interface design

### Map display

- Basic display of the map
- Path drawing
- Display navigation keywords

### Interaction with the map

- Zoom in & Zoom out
- specify location for starting and destiny location
  - Using text input and then search a location
  - Using pin-point to specify a location

## Documentation & Test

### Test

- Module test
  - Better to provide module test report, a brief one
- Application test
  - Base on user feedback (if we can release one version before the deadline)

### Comment of the code

- Try the best to provide brief but clear comment on import functions, classes

### User guide

- Installation
  - Maybe specific installation guide for different platform

### Bug report

- listing the known bugs

### Final report

- Require knowledge on `Tex`
- a discussion on `What shall we put in this`
